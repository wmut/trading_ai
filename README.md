A toolbox for automatically executing AI trading strategies. 

Functionality: 
- Generates various signals (SMI, EMA, Bollinger, RSI, MACD) for a growth stock (BTCUSD)
- Execute simple trading strategies based on trading signals (50/200 MA and Bollinger band crosses) and compare results with a buy-and-hold strategy

Ideas:
- Implement more tickers, in particular those belonging to different market segments (e.g. value and growth)
- Implement an API to an external LLM and fetch more data such as current market sentiment, and analysis for last week/month/quarter etc.
- Implement Dashboards such as current market analysis, next week/month/quarter forecast, trading strategy performance, risk management etc.
- Implement other trading stategies and automatically backtest them
- Build a tiny, fully dockerized AI trading platform (24/7 operability, updating market and risk dashboards, executing trades)
